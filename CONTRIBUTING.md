# Contributing to Topological-JAX

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this research tool!

## Standard for Contributions
- **Scientific Accuracy**: Every pull request (PR) that alters the Hamiltonian logic must include a validation case (e.g., comparing numerical results with known analytical limits).
- **Code Style**: We use JAX-idiomatic code. Prefer functional programming patterns and avoid global state.
- **Documentation**: Ensure that any new physical model is accompanied by a brief LaTeX explanation in the docstrings.

## How to Submit a PR
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/new-lattice-model`).
3. Commit your changes with clear, descriptive messages.
4. Push to the branch and open a Pull Request.

For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
