## **Overview**

**Topological-JAX** is a high-performance numerical framework designed to investigate the electronic properties and topological invariants of 2D lattice systems. By leveraging **JAX (Autograd and XLA)**, this library provides a robust environment for calculating band structures, Berry phases, and Chern numbers with machine-precision accuracy via automatic differentiation and differentiable programming.

The repository implements several cornerstone models of condensed matter physics:
1.  **Graphene** (Massless and Massive Dirac Fermions).
2.  **QWZ Model** (Qi-Wu-Zhang) on a square lattice.
3.  **Haldane Model** (The primordial Chern Insulator) on a honeycomb lattice.

## **Key Objectives**

-   **Precision Localization:** Utilizing JAX-based Jacobian matrices to perform Newton-Raphson refinement for locating Dirac points ($K$-points) in the Brillouin Zone.
-   **Topological Characterization:** Implementing the **Fukui-Hatsugai-Suzuki** algorithm to compute gauge-invariant Berry curvatures and integer Chern numbers.
-   **Kinetic Analysis:** Fitting the Fermi velocity ($v_F$) using radial energy dispersion around Dirac cones.
-   **Differentiable Physics:** Demonstrating the use of XLA-compiled loops and vectorized maps (`vmap`) for efficient BZ integration.

## **Technical Implementations**

### **1. Lattice Geometry & Hamiltonian Construction**
The framework constructs real-space and reciprocal-space vectors for honeycomb and square lattices. The Hamiltonians are defined as $H(\mathbf{k})$ matrices, allowing for the inclusion of:
-   Nearest-neighbor (NN) hopping.
-   Next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) complex hopping (Haldane phase $\phi$).
-   On-site staggered potential (Semenoff mass).

### **2. Newton Refinement for Dirac Points**
Unlike traditional analytical approximations, this repo uses `jax.jacobian` to iteratively solve for $\mathbf{k}$ where the gap vanishes:
$$ \Delta E(\mathbf{k}) = |f(\mathbf{k})| = 0 $$
This allows the code to be adaptable to strained lattices where Dirac points may shift from high-symmetry positions.

### **3. Berry Curvature & Chern Number**
We implement the discrete lattice field theory approach (Fukui et al.). For a given band $n$, the Chern number $\mathcal{C}_n$ is calculated by summing the flux of the Berry connection across the discretized Brillouin Zone:
$$ U_{\mu}(\mathbf{k}_l) = \frac{\langle n(\mathbf{k}_l) | n(\mathbf{k}_l + \mathbf{e}_\mu) \rangle}{|\langle n(\mathbf{k}_l) | n(\mathbf{k}_l + \mathbf{e}_\mu) \rangle|} $$
This method ensures that the Chern number remains an exact integer even on relatively coarse grids.

## **Results & Output**

Running the main script provides:
-   **Graphene Analysis:** Refined $K$-point coordinates, numerical vs. analytical Fermi velocity, and the $\pi$ Berry phase around the Dirac point.
-   **QWZ Phase Map:** A scan of Chern numbers $\mathcal{C} \in \{1, 0, -1\}$ relative to the mass parameter $m$.
-   **Haldane Topology:** Verification of the topological phase transition by varying the topological mass $M$ and the phase $\phi$.

## **Project Structure**

```bash
├── src/
│   └── topological_jax.py   # Core implementation (Hamiltonians, Solvers, Integrators)
├── README.md                # Documentation
└── requirements.txt         # JAX, JAXlib, Matplotlib
```

## **Installation**

To run the simulations, ensure you have JAX installed (configured for CPU or GPU):

```bash
pip install jax jaxlib matplotlib
```

## **Limitations**

-   **Single-Particle Picture:** The current implementation focuses on non-interacting Hamiltonians (Tight-Binding Model).
-   **Periodic Boundary Conditions:** The Chern number calculations assume a clean, infinite crystal (Bulk topology). Edge state analysis (Ribbon geometry) is not included in the current version.
-   **Zero Temperature:** Calculations are performed for the ground state electronic structure.
